Progress: I have made progress and complete all of the data cleaning and merging tasks. 
I have created a regression model that decently predicts, but still looking to find a way to get the simulation to work with solid accuracy.

Problems: I am stuck on the simulation. I am working through best processes to create a simulation and still improving my understanding of the use of simulations. 
I am also working with whether I should simulate the applicants, or just the draw percentage.

Plans: I plan to continue to explore the internet for information on simulations and then continue to try and work through the necessary coding.

Hours: I have spent 20 hours or so over break on my project leading up to this week. Last week was chaotic for me so my work on it was slightly less.
