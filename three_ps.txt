Progress: I spent the week working on different models to try and find the best fitting one. While there was not a clear cut "best" model. I did settle upon one that I think will be acceptable moving forward in this project.

Problems: I am having some problems trying to do the calculations with the modeled data because of some data formatting issues. It's not a huge problem and I will have it resolved with a few more hours of troubleshooting.

Plans: I plan to fix the problems then quality check my work and hopefully start working on more of the digital product moving forward.

Progress: I have made progress and complete all of the data cleaning and merging tasks. 
I have created a regression model that decently predicts, but still looking to find a way to get the simulation to work with solid accuracy.

Problems: I am stuck on the simulation. I am working through best processes to create a simulation and still improving my understanding of the use of simulations. 
I am also working with whether I should simulate the applicants, or just the draw percentage.

Plans: I plan to continue to explore the internet for information on simulations and then continue to try and work through the necessary coding.

Hours: I have spent 20 hours or so over break on my project leading up to this week. Last week was chaotic for me so my work on it was slightly less.
